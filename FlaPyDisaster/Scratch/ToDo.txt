Things to do:
	- Leaflet/Mapping/Javascript
		-) Add leaflet draw
		-) Add more user control to web page
			-] hide layers
			-] layer access in general
			-] change breaks/colors from the mapping page
		-) figure out why you sometimes cant add stuff twice (eps. 'Asteroid Test Style')
		-) Start making things not 'Test' anymore
		-) better 'create event' tools needed, probably need draw for it first
			-] use draw to define bounding box
			-] move and save event (when appropriate)
		-) D3 visualizations...?
	- Python
		-) add more to color palettes
		-) make mapping "api" routes more useful
		-) make event inheritance work a bit better
	- Application
		-) Put routes into a separate package (may need to create package and copy file contents instead of move contents)
		-) maybe subpackage this whole program?
		-) move html in templates into an 'html' folder
		-) add a save/load component
			-] Need to save load from compact format (images)
			-] Need an associated ini file probably
			-] Maybe explore geodatabase
	- Science
		-) validate asteroid calculations with something?
		-) implement math for a hurricane model
			-] Inflow angle needs to be done
			-] make sure units are consistent (m/s, mph, km/h, nauts, miles, km, nautical miles ... so many)
			-] Validate
